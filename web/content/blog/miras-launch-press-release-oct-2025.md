The question that haunts every crypto holder: what happens to my digital assets when I'm gone? Today, we're thrilled to announce the launch of Miras — the trustless inheritance protocol that ensures your crypto outlives you.

## Billions Lost, Now Found

It's no secret that billions in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and NFTs have been lost forever due to inaccessible wallets. Miras solves this with a decentralized, encrypted protocol that automatically transfers your assets to your heirs — once death or incapacity is confirmed by our on-chain network of attesters.

Our tagline says it all: **Death Happens. Be Ready.**

## The Inheritance Revolution on Chain

We've combined Smart Contracts, Attester Registries, and Encrypted Safes to create what we call a "self-executing digital will." Through open-source contracts and attestation logic, your heirs can inherit without ever accessing your keys or trusting a lawyer.

Key innovations powering Miras:

- **SafeTable**: Securely stores encrypted references to your assets.
- **ClaimsDB**: Tracks inheritance claims initiated by your heirs.
- **AttesterRegistry**: A decentralized network that confirms death/incapacity.
- **MRS Token**: The utility token powering the ecosystem.
- **wMRS**: A yield-bearing wrapped version of MRS for passive income.

As our core team puts it: "Legacy and decentralization don’t have to be opposites. We’ve built a system that honors both — privacy for the living, and assurance for those left behind."

## Death Meets DeFi

Unlike traditional wills or custodial solutions, Miras operates entirely on-chain. Heirs submit encrypted claims tied to verified safes, while attesters stake MRS tokens to participate in verification — risking slashing for false claims. When consensus is reached, assets transfer automatically to your heir’s wallet.

Meanwhile, wMRS holders earn passive yield from protocol fees, so you benefit even while alive. If DeFi is the future of finance, Miras is the future of legacy.

## DAO-Governed and Future-Proof

Miras runs under a DAO-controlled UUPS architecture. A multisig council handles governance, treasury management, and upgrades, ensuring stability and transparency. The DAO treasury funds audits, attester rewards, and future integrations — from legal document verification to cross-chain support.

## About Miras

Miras is a trustless inheritance protocol built on Ethereum. We leverage encryption, decentralized verification, and upgradeable smart contracts to provide the first truly autonomous digital legacy framework.

Our ecosystem includes SafeTable, AttesterRegistry, and ClaimsDB — all designed to give you peace of mind.
